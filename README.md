Heart-related diseases are the leading cause of death and have emerged as the most-threatening disease in the whole world. One of the most common reasons is that the experts in medical centers lack experience in detecting the occurrence of heart disease which results in a significant rate of incorrectly diagnosed cases. This study aimed to identify the most effective machine learning algorithm in predicting the occurrence of heart disease. Hence, the heart_disease dataset is chosen where the occurrence of heart disease of each patient is determined based on the attributes such as age, chest pain type, resting blood pressure and so on. We are going to use three machine learning algorithms namely K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the occurrence of heart disease based on the features provided. All the features are ranked to identify which features have a higher correlation to our target by using heatmap and we build machine learning models based on relevant factors. The most effective machine learning model in predicting the occurrence of heart disease has been identified and recommendations are given on how and when to implement the machine learning algorithms.
